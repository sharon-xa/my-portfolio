# Tips For A Better Portfolio Creation

NOTE: The projects that you should be showing to the employer:

- First don't put too much projects in your portfolio,
   6 is a good number of projects, choose your best projects.
- Second try to build projects by yourself that are unique and beautiful
   cuz employers see alot of portfolios everyday
   if you use a project from a course the employer probably have seen that project a 1000 time already,
   so try building your own projects and don't be goofy (like me).
- Third your projects should be diverse as the following:
   1. A game.
   2. A website that showcase a product (This should be your CSS FLEX).
   3. A store.
   4. An alternative front-end for any website (good luck trying to find a free api).
   5. A chat app
   6. A blog
   7. A dashboard
