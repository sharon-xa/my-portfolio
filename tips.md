NOTE: The projects that you should be showing to the employer:

-  First don't put too much projects in your portfolio,
   6 is a good number of projects, choose your best projects.
-  Second try to build projects by yourself that are unique and beautiful
   cuz employers see alot of portfolios everyday
   if you use a project from a course the employer probably have seen that project a 1000 time already,
   so try building your own projects and don't be goofy (like me).
-  Third your projects should be diverse as the following:

   1. a game.
   2. a website that showcase a product (This should be your CSS FLEX).
   3. a store.
   4. an alternative front-end for any website (good luck trying to find a free api).
   5. a chat app
   6. a blog
   7. a dashboard
