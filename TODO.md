# TODO LIST

-  **HOME Page** => in the `GithubProfileImage.js` file I have some problems (the fetching process is being repeated).
   we should fetch the image with a seprate loader.

-  **PROJECTS Page** => a modal to show off the picture of the website

-  maybe a sticky navbar?

-  a light mode?
